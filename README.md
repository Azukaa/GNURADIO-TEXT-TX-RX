# GNURADIO-TX-RX-TEXT
This project gives a detailed explanation on how to build a Digital transmitter and receiver for transmitting and receiving texts using GNU Radio blocks and python programming based on Pulse amplitude modulation with different pulse shapes. 


**pulse_shapes.py is thepython program that gives different pulse shapes that were implemented in carrying out the simulation
